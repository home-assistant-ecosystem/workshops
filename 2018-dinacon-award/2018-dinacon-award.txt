Total stars (of the most important repos): 17.5 k
Total forks (of the most important repos): 7 k



Project Other Metrics
Do you have metrics that you would like to share with us, which help us to understand how successful your project is? (downloads, visits on website, registered users, etc.)

https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/homeassistant/

- There are around 50 contributor for every release.
- Over 50 k installations are sharing details with us like the release or the operating system they use.
- There are a little under 25 k users in the Community forum and they created 150 k postings in the last year.
- The Docker images was pulled over 15 million times.
- We have over 20 million unique pages views for the documentation over the last 12 months.
- and we have over 8 k followers on Twitter ;-)

Project Community Roles
Does your project have a non-coder community e.g. UX designer, translator, marketing, etc.? What kind of non-coder people are involved in your project?

Yes, it does but unfortunately it's not as big and diverse as we would like it to be.

There are teachers, physicians, doctors, house wives and school kids who are helping to make Home Assistant better by doing translations, writing documentation, making icons, creating projects, bringing uses cases to the table or answering questions. Home Assistant is in the lucky position to attract people which different educations and jobs through the whole society. 


Project Business Case
Please describe the business case of your project.

Home Assistant solves the issue of having silos in your home. Instead of having multiple "apps" on a smart phone to control the devices from various vendors in your home. The lights, media players, blinds, heating and all other supported devices can be controlled from a modern and fast web interface. The "smart things" or Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are no longer isolated as Home Assistant and it's automation engine is technology agnostic, vendor agnostic and Open Source. The devices can interact with each other no matter of their brand or supported protocol and limitations defined by the manufacturers can be overcome.

With its wide range of device support is Home Assistant the best choice for future-proof smart home installation. Without manufacturer cloud solutions involved your data will stay private and your home will work even if there is no internet connection. 

Project Commercial Use
How relevant is your project in regard to a commercial use?

This is a pure non-profit project


Project Importance
This project is important to the world because....

... it ensures that sensor and control data of your home stay private.
... there is no remote access allowed by default and no internet connection needed after the installation to automate your home.
... it gives you back the control without depending on vendors and third-party providers and removes the requirement to buy all hardware from the same vendor.
... the users shouldn't need to care about protocols and vendor limitations. 
... it makes your home automation installation sustainable, future-proof and easy to extend.


Project Stop Impact
If this project stops its development and ceases to exist, this would be the impact...

The current state of the project can be described as "stable and mature". All core elements of the project have proven to work well under different conditions. This means that existing installations would continue to work. Over time the amount of working integrations would decrease as API changes and other modifications wouldn't be available and render certain devices useless. 

As of today, it's highly unlikely that the development of project stops. There is a lot of momentum in the community and for the development, even more than in the previous years. Also, the project is using popular tools and languages which are broadly supported across the whole Open Source ecosystem.
